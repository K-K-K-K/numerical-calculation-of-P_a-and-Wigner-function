# numerical-calculation-of-P_a-and-Wigner-function
This program numerically calculates P_a and Wigner function to search eta(transmissivity of beamsplitter) which approximate photon-subtracted squeezed vacuum state become non-convex gaussian state having positive wigner function.

## environment
- Python 3.6.9
- numpy 1.19.5
